# BraTS2017
Repository with models, experiments and our final approach for the BraTS 2017 tumor segmentation challenge.

This repository is based on the cnn-nolearn repository with modifications for multiclass segmentation. 
At some point I migh merge the changes. However, the final approach (and most likely weights) for the challenge will be public here.
